    freeglut installation
    glut code/workflow

    context creation:
        opengl does not specify window management
        window toolkit provides opengl context
         uses this context to call functions

functions: 
    glClear

coordinates transformations are done by multiplying matricies for every step.
opengl expects normalised coordinates ie. in range from -1 to 1
local coordinates are coordinates with respect to the local origin of the model.
